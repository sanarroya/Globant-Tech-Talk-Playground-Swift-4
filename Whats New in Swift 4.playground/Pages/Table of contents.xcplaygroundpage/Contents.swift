 ## Required Tools
 
 This playground requires Swift 4. Xcode 9 includes Swift 4 by default ([download Xcode 9 beta from developer.apple.com][Xcode 9]). You can also run it in Xcode 8.3, but you need to install a Swift 4 toolchain (donʼt worry, itʼs easy):
 1. Download [the latest Swift 4.0 snapshot from swift.org][Snapshot downloads].
 1. Run the installer to install the snapshot.
 1. In Xcode, go to _Xcode > Toolchains > Manage Toolchains…_ and select the snapshot:
 
 ![][xcode-8-3-toolchain-dialog]
 
 
 It might be a good idea to quit and relaunch Xcode after switching snapshots. I had occasional problems with syntax highlighting and code completion that a relaunch fixed.
